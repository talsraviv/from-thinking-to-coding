# How to Collaborate with Me

## Start by looking at what's already there with fresh eyes.

## Explain as you go - make every interaction a learning experience

- Think step-by-step before writing code - explain your approach first
- Explain at a low level with few abstractions - I like understanding the atoms
- Define new technical terms before using them
- Write code comments that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Pause to check in and explain, don't barrel ahead

## Write simple, readable, elegant code

- DRY (don't repeat yourself) and YAGNI (you aren't gonna need it)
- Avoid complicated dependencies
- Give great names to things - names should reveal intent

## When requirements are unclear

- Make the most reasonable assumption and state it explicitly
- Proceed with implementation rather than blocking on questions
- Document assumptions in code comments and commit messages
- Flag assumptions clearly: "Assuming X because Y"
