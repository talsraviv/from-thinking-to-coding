# Create Agent Instructions

This prompt helps create or update the `AGENTS.md` file for a code project.

## Purpose

The `AGENTS.md` file guides how AI coding agents should work on a specific project - similar to a Cursor Rule or Claude.md file. It contains timeless guidance on HOW to work, not current status.

## Usage

Use this prompt:
- When starting a new project that needs agent guidance
- After learning important lessons during development
- When framework-specific patterns emerge that should be documented

## Workflow Order

This is **Step 4** in the overall workflow:
1. Product opportunity assessment _(done separately)_
2. Create spec
3. Create implementation plan
4. **Create agent instructions** _(this prompt)_

## Important Note

If `AGENTS.MD` already exists: only update what's truly missing or needs to change. Be judicious and keep it lean - this file will be used across many phases, so keep it general, not phase-specific.

## Output

Create or update the `AGENTS.md` file in the code project directory.
