# What AGENTS.md IS

**What AGENTS.md IS:**
- Timeless guidance on HOW to work on this project
- Framework-specific gotchas and patterns
- Development workflow and conventions
- Key lessons learned (technical insights that apply going forward)

**What AGENTS.md is NOT:**
- Current project status (that goes in README.md)
- Product and implementation plan (that lives in the spec and plan)
- Detailed testing procedures (that goes in TESTING.md)

Keep docs minimal - consolidate when possible. Avoid creating redundant status-tracking files.
