# DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

When you see duplication, extract it. When you're about to copy-paste, stop and abstract.

Duplication is the root of maintenance nightmares - change one place, forget another, bugs multiply.
