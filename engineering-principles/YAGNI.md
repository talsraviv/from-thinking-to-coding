# YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It

Don't build features until you actually need them.

Resist the temptation to add "just in case" functionality. Every line of code is a liability - it must be understood, tested, and maintained.

Build the simplest thing that works. Add complexity only when reality demands it.
