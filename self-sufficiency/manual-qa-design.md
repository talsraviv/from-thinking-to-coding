# Manual QA Design

I will still do manual QA, so design this so it's very clear and easy and fast for me to test manually:

- Easy to run and startup and reset (and anything else required to verify)
- Create "hidden" dev features that make it easy to skip ahead to advanced states quickly (and also ways for you to set things up in particular states so I can focus on testing particular parts without having to go through the whole flow)
- When it's time for manual testing, walk me through it step by step. Tell me what to do and wait for my confirmation, then provide the next step.
