# Testing Best Practices

## Testing approach

- Write tests that teach - tests should demonstrate how code works
- Prefer simple, readable test cases over comprehensive coverage for learning projects
- For production experiments, test the core path first, edge cases second
- Always include a way to manually test/demo the feature
- Update test documentation when behavior changes

## Verification workflow

- Verify changes work before moving on (run, test, inspect output)
- If something breaks, fix it immediately - don't leave broken code
