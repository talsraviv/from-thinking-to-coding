# Error Handling

Error handling on everything. Everything can fail. Make no assumptions. Handle errors explicitly, never silently

- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Log errors with enough context for debugging
- User-facing errors should suggest what to do next
- Verbose errors are better than silent failures
