# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but please read this first.

## Philosophy

This workflow emerged from real development experience with AI coding agents, not from theory or internet best practices.

**What I'm looking for:**
- Improvements based on **actual use** of this workflow
- Solutions to **real problems** you encountered
- Additions that made your work **measurably better**

**What I'm not looking for:**
- Suggestions from internet best practices or blog posts
- Ideas you read on social media but haven't tried
- Theoretical improvements or programming superstitions
- Changes for the sake of completeness

## How to Contribute

1. **Use it first.** Build something real with this workflow.
2. **Find a problem.** Notice where it breaks down or could be clearer.
3. **Test your solution.** Use the improved version on another project.
4. **Submit a PR.** Include context about what problem you faced and how your change helped.

## What to Include in Your PR

- **The problem**: What didn't work or was unclear?
- **Your experience**: How did you encounter this? What were you building?
- **The solution**: What did you change?
- **The result**: How did this improve your work?

Keep it succinct. Show your work.
