# Discovery Phase

## Learn what's up first

Check out the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting off - on top of what already exists in this repo (if unclear, please ask me what code repo specifically as there are many unrelated ones).

Before asking any questions, read relevant existing code, docs, and configs. Understand what works, what patterns exist, what could be leveraged.

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.
