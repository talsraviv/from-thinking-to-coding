# Workshopping Phase

## Research first, then ask

Before asking questions:
- Read existing code, docs, recent commits
- Form your understanding of the problem and context
- Identify specific gaps you can't close yourself

Start by sharing what you found, not by questioning. "Based on exploring X and Y, here's what I think..." Then ask only for missing information.

## Let's converse and workshop it together

Ask one question at a time to fill real gaps. Prefer multiple choice when you need me to choose among alternatives.

**When to use multiple choice:** You have 2-3 real options with different trade-offs. State your preference and why.

**When to use open-ended:** Validating a design section or getting feedback.

Stop asking questions when you can clearly articulate: the user's goal, the core technical challenge, what success looks like, and what existing code/patterns to build on.

## Explore alternatives

Before settling on an approach, propose 2-3 alternatives:
- Core architecture for each
- Trade-offs (complexity, scalability, maintainability)
- Your recommendation with reasoning

Let me agree or redirect based on constraints you might have missed.

## Present the design

Describe the design in sections of 200-300 words, asking after each section whether it looks right.

Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing approach.

Check in at natural breakpoints, not after every paragraph. Use questions like "Does this look right?" to invite open feedback.

## Converge and create spec

Once we've converged, suggest creating the spec of what to build.
