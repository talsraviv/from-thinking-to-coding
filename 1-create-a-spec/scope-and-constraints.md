# Scope and Constraints

## The main goal of this document is to decide the scope of what we should build

- What are the key most important features you'd include to achieve my goals? 
- Focus on what's truly essential to my goals, and ruthlessly cut everything else, so we can get to value fast. 
- Be explicit about what's out of scope. Include a short list of the "parking lot" that's out of scope: What is not important right now, and won't be addressed, but potentially a good idea to consider later?

## Don't plan the order of execution yet

- Once you finish, we will work on an implementation plan afterwards.
- Don't address phases etc. this document should focus on what is the scope and the "what", not the order of operations.

## Take advantage of what already exists in the codebase

- Default to existing technologies and patterns unless there's a strong reason to change
- Avoid big rewrites - prefer incremental improvements
- Identify which existing code/components can be reused or extended

## This will be used by a capable AI coding agent

- Don't write code, readmes, or docs - just describe what's needed
- Specify the "what" not the "how" - let the agent determine implementation details
- Be specific about requirements and constraints, not about implementation approach

## Prioritize security

- What are best practices for the chosen technologies that we must incorporate

## Important to read @self-sufficiency.md here

Design this in a way to really empower an ai coding agent to be self sufficient
