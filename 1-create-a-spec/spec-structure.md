# Spec Structure

## Writing the spec document

### How to create it
- Add it to the same opportunity assessment as its own section, "Detailed spec"

### Architecture and system design
- Include a high-level architecture diagram (ASCII art is fine)
- Show data flow and key components
- Identify integration points with existing code
- Map out the request/response cycle for main user flows
