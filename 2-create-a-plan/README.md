# Create a Plan

This prompt helps turn a technical specification into a lightweight execution plan.

## Usage

Use this prompt when you have a completed spec and need to create an implementation plan with phases that an AI coding agent can execute.

## Workflow Order

This is **Step 3** in the overall workflow:
1. Product opportunity assessment _(done separately)_
2. Create spec
3. **Create implementation plan** _(this prompt)_
4. Update agent instructions

## Output

The implementation plan should be added to the same opportunity assessment as a new section called "Implementation plan".
