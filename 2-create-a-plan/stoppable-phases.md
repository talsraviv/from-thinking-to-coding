# Stoppable Phases

## Don't assume we'll execute the entire plan

- Each phase is self-sufficient and high-quality - can pause after any phase
- I may delete phases, so make them self-contained
- Avoid waterfall steps like "write all documentation" or "final UI polish"
- Instead, do hygiene tasks (docs, tests, polish) incrementally in each phase
